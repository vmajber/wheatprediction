## Wheat yield forecast

The project in the repositroy forecasts wheat yields based on weather data. The data sources are referenced in the data_download notebook. The built models are in the models.ipynb file. The project concluded that the RMSE could be reduced to 0.86 (for the average it was 3.78). 
The project also includes a thesis, I put the figures used for this in the visual file.
